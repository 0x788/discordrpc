## Getting Started
1. Create an Application on `https://discord.com/developers/applications` and click `New Application`
2. Once you created your Discord Application will have to Copy your Client ID and paste it into  the program where it says Application ID (make sure to delete the text first)
3. Now click `Rich Presence`, this is where you can add pictures that will be shown in your Presence.  You will have to wait a couple minutes to let Discord save the picture.
4. This is the final step. Fill out all Text Boxes in the App and click `Initialize`. After that you can click Update and view your custom Presence
